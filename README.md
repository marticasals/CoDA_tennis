### Manuscript submitted to the Austrian Journal of Statistics

This repository contains the data and analysis for the manuscript "*Court surfaces: A compositional approach to tennis analytics*," which has been submitted to the journal [Austrian Journal of Statistics](https://ajs.or.at/index.php/ajs/index).

## Data

The dataset includes information about professional tennis players and their participation across different court surfaces. The data was collected to explore how surface preferences impact player performance and ranking. Below is a list and description of the key variables collected and analyzed for each player category.

#### Table: Description of variables of the manuscript

| **Variable**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Player**                 | The name of the player.                                                          |
| **Best ranking number**    | The highest ATP ranking achieved by the player.                                  |
| **Best ranking category**  | The category of ranking based on performance: High (1-30), Medium (31-75), Low (76-100). |
| **Date of last best ranking**| The date when the player last achieved their best ranking.                      |
| **Present status**         | The current playing status of the player (e.g., active, retired).               |
| **Number of tournaments played on each surface** | The number of tournaments played by the player on clay, hard, and grass surfaces. |
| **Total minutes played**   | The total number of minutes played by the player on each surface.               |
| **Games played**           | The total number of games played on each surface by the player.                 |
| **Handedness**             | Whether the player is right-handed or left-handed.                               |
| **Backhand style**         | The type of backhand used by the player (one-handed or two-handed).             |

### Purpose of the Data

This dataset is designed to support an analysis of how players' surface preferences, handedness, and backhand style are associated with their rankings and participation patterns. The compositional approach used in this study highlights the relationships between time spent on different surfaces and player performance, offering valuable insights into the tactical choices of professional tennis players.

The variables included in the dataset provide detailed information about the career trajectories of ATP players, allowing for an in-depth exploration of how the distribution of matches across surfaces correlates with overall performance and ranking.
